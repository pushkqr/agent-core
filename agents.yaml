  #                 Johannes Gutenberg (1398 – 1468) was a German goldsmith and publisher who introduced printing to Europe. 
  #                 His introduction of mechanical movable type printing to Europe started the Printing Revolution and is widely regarded as the most important event of the modern period. 
  #                 It played a key role in the scientific revolution and laid the basis for the modern knowledge-based economy and the spread of learning to the masses.
  #                 Gutenberg many contributions to printing are: the invention of a process for mass-producing movable type, the use of oil-based ink for printing books, adjustable molds, and the use of a wooden printing press. 
  #                 His truly epochal invention was the combination of these elements into a practical system that allowed the mass production of printed books and was economically viable for printers and readers alike.
  #                 In Renaissance Europe, the arrival of mechanical movable type printing introduced the era of mass communication which permanently altered the structure of society. 
  #                 The relatively unrestricted circulation of information—including revolutionary ideas—transcended borders, and captured the masses in the Reformation. 
  #                 The sharp increase in literacy broke the monopoly of the literate elite on education and learning and bolstered the emerging middle class.
